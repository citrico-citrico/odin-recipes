            <li>1/3 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
            <li>4 processed cheese singles (such as kraft)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon thousand island salad dressing</li>
            <li>1 slice tomato</li>
            <li>1 leaf lettuce</li>
            <li>1 slcie onion</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a large skillet over medium heat. 
                Place hamburger bun halves, cut-sides down, 
                in the hot skillet until lightly toasted, 2 to 
                3 minutes. Remove toasted buns to a plate.</li>
            <li>Separate beef into 2 portions and form each
                 into a thin patty slightly larger than 
                 bottom bun. Season each patty with salt.</li>
            <li>Cook patties in the same large skillet over 
                medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Flip patties 
                over and place 2 cheese slices over each patty. 
                Continue cooking until desired doneness is 
                reached, 2 to 3 minutes more. An instant-read 
                thermometer inserted into the center of patties 
                should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C) for 
                well done.</li>
            <li>Assemble cheeseburger in the following order: 
                bottom bun, dressing, tomato, lettuce, beef 
                patty with cheese, onion, beef patty with 
                cheese, and top bun.</li>
        </ol>
